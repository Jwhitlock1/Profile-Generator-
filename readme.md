For this unit we started off our node skills by visiting a familiar topic: APIs and making calls to them. Additionally, we learned more about the functionallity available with NPMs, including:

Inquirer
HTML-pdf
Axios
Using template literals and NPMs I have created a simple application that takes in the user's GitHub user name and allows them to make a choice between four colors, then after retrieving the information requested of the GitHub API generates both an HTML template and finally a pdf.
